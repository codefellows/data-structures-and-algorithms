# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Repository Setup

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository, at the top level is a folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

- Each Data Structure should be implemented separately in a language specific manner, in a properly named folder.
  - i.e. `linked-lists`
- For daily challenges:
  - Each implementation should have a challenges folder, named `challenges`
  - Within the challenges folder, a subfolder bearing the name of the challenge
    - i.e. `remove-duplicates`
  - Within the proper subfolder:
    - A README.md that will house your challenge summary, whiteboard photos
    - Your implementation and tests for the code challenge
    - Perform your work in accordance with your 401 language's instructions

The final structure should resemble this:

```bash
